## Making a new published post

Make a new file using the date prefix of `YYYYMMDD`, such as:

```
../content/brendan/posts/20101230_example-published-post-title.md
```

## Making a new draft post

Make a new file using the date prefix of `999DRAFT`, such as:

```
../content/brendan/posts/999DRAFT_example-draft-post-title.md
```

Draft posts won't be included in the posts feed and will only be visible on local environments (`APP_ENV=local` in the `.env` file).
