## About ##

Here's my personal website built on [Kirby](https://github.com/bastianallgeier/kirby) with [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com) and hosted by [Digital Ocean](http://digitalocean.com).

I've also built a customised *pulse feed* on the home page to show my public activity on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/brendanmurty), [GitHub](https://github.com/brendanmurty) and [Instagram](http://instagram.com/highhorser).

## Why ##

I was inspired by [Brad Frost](https://github.com/bradfrost)'s [TED talk](https://twitter.com/brad_frost/status/476515058738925568) about being open by default. If you haven't seen this talk yet, I'd recommend investing half an hour to watch the video and read the blog post.

As I'm self-taught, learning by example helped my start my career. I hope a budding web developer can learn something new from what I've done here and start their own career. Hopefully I can give back to the community that has taught me so much over the last few years.
