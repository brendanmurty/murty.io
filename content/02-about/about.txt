I'm a Senior Web Developer currently working as *Lead Developer: [Siteflex](http://siteflex.com.au/) Classic* where my roles include managing client and internal requests, fixing bugs and developing features for the Siteflex [web management platform](http://www.siteflex.com.au/).

In some [spare time](http://www.solutionsoutsourced.com.au/blog/n/tinker-time-produces-a-new-app-upcomingtasks-121017), I created a free [open-source](https://github.com/brendanmurty/upcomingtasks) responsive [Basecamp](https://basecamp.com/) client called [UpcomingTasks](http://upcomingtasks.com) to easily manage tasks on smaller devices.

I share my thoughts on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/brendanmurty), save bookmarks to [Pinboard](https://pinboard.in/u:brendanmurty), post photos to [Instagram](http://instagram.com/highhorser), listen to music on [Rdio](http://www.rdio.com/people/brendanmurty) and share my code on [GitHub](https://github.com/brendanmurty).

I enjoy spending time with [family](http://islamurty.com/) and friends, [playing games](http://steamcommunity.com/id/brendanmurty) and reviewing [schnitzels](http://schnitmydadsays.com/).
