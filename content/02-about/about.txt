Text:

I'm a Senior Web Developer with over five years of commercial experience in many areas of website development. I'm proficient with various front-end and back-end platforms and programming languages and strive to learn improved methods and techniques to solve complex problems for clients.

In some [spare time](http://www.solutionsoutsourced.com.au/blog/n/tinker-time-produces-a-new-app-upcomingtasks-121017), I created a free [open-source](https://github.com/brendanmurty/upcomingtasks) responsive [Basecamp](https://basecamp.com/) client called [UpcomingTasks](http://upcomingtasks.com) to easily manage tasks on smaller devices.

I share my thoughts on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/brendanmurty), post photos to [Instagram](http://instagram.com/highhorser), track music statistics on [Last.fm](http://www.last.fm/user/brendanmurty), manage my code on [GitHub](https://github.com/brendanmurty) and find inspiration on [Pinterest](http://www.pinterest.com/brendanmurty).

I enjoy spending time with [family](http://islamurty.com/) and friends, [playing games](http://steamcommunity.com/id/brendanmurty) and reviewing [schnitzels](http://schnitmydadsays.com/).
