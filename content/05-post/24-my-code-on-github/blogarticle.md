I've just migrated this website, [UpcomingTasks](https://upcomingtasks.com/) and [my code snippets](https://github.com/brendanmurty/code-snippets) to [GitHub](https://github.com/). This allows me to easily make changes to my code and rollback if things go wrong!

As for deployment to the websites, I'm giving [Deploy](http://deployhq.com) a trial. Deploy allows me to automatically push changes from GitHub to live website servers.

Want to check out my code? [Follow me on GitHub](https://github.com/brendanmurty).
