            "20130404_trip-to-new-york": "# Trip to New York\n_4 Apr 2013_\n\nI recently visited New York to see how [Ella](https:\/\/twitter.com\/ellacondon) was going with her studies there. I had some vague plans *(who wants to overplan a holiday anyway)* of what to see and do when I was there. This was the first time I\u2019d visited New York and also the USA, so I had a few challenges along the way. However, these certainly weren\u2019t to do the people I met over there, who were all kind and helpful but somewhat louder than I expected.\n\nI was welcomed in to the country by a very friendly airport employee at [LAX](http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Los_Angeles_International_Airport) and experienced some snow on the way in to [JFK](http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/John_F._Kennedy_International_Airport) which was pretty magical. Getting to the city via the shuttle late at night in decent levels of snow was also beautiful.\n\n![Snow](\/images\/brendan\/ny-snow.jpg)\n*It was pretty cold that first night*\n\nNaturally, first on my list was a recommendation from [Brett](https:\/\/twitter.com\/theromulans) to visit a specific diner where he\u2019d enjoyed a fine burger in the past. Specifically, this diner was named [J.G. Melon](http:\/\/www.urbanspoon.com\/r\/3\/30459\/restaurant\/Upper-East-Side\/J-G-Melon-New-York), and it was certainly worth the trek. I ordered a Bacon Cheeseburger ($10.50). It was a tantalising mix of meat and cheese, perfected with a side of cottage fried potatoes. This was the first and best burger of my trip.\n\n![Burger](\/images\/brendan\/ny-burger.jpg)\n*J.G. Melon, 1291 3rd Ave*\n\nAs a huge fan of the [Seinfeld](http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Seinfeld) series, I just had to visit the diner that they used for external shots in the early series. [Tom\u2019s Restaurant](http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Tom's_Restaurant) is located in the upper west side of the city and has become a bit of a tourist destination. Obviously, we had to see what the food was like. It wasn\u2019t very exciting really, but they still managed a decent American burger for a fair price!\n\n![Tom's](\/images\/brendan\/ny-toms.jpg)\n*Tom\u2019s Restaurant, 2880 Broadway*\n\nAside from the cheap food, there are also some pretty spectacular views in this city. One of the most surprising to me was [Grand Central](http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Grand_Central_Terminal) terminal, which certainly lives up to it\u2019s name.\n\n![Grand Central](\/images\/brendan\/ny-grand.jpg)\n*Largest American flag I\u2019ve ever seen*\n\n[Coney Island](http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Coney_Island) was also a favourite of mine. After receiving a fair amount of damage from [Hurricane Sandy](http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Hurricane_Sandy), Coney Island feels almost like a ghost town.\n\n![Coney Island](\/images\/brendan\/ny-coney.jpg)\n*The Coney Island boardwalk*\n\nAnother location with some awesome views is [Central Park](http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Central_Park), which acts as an escape from the busy city for the locals and tourists alike.\n\n![Central Park](\/images\/brendan\/ny-central.jpg)\n*One of the many views of the city from Central Park*\n\nI\u2019d love to return to this beautiful city in the near future, I might even plan it out a little more!",

However, if you're simply after a quick way to access the key websites you use day to day, creating a shortcut app doesn't require huge amounts of effort.\n\n![Chrome apps sample](\/images\/brendan\/chrome-apps.png)\n*Some of my current shortcut apps*\n\nBasically, a Chrome shortcut app consists of two files: a plain text JSON file and an PNG image for the icon. These files should be stored in the same folder.\n\nThe image should be a 128px x 128px transparent PNG, named **128.png**.\n\nThe JSON file is pretty simple, check out the example below and name it **manifest.json**.\nCustomise this by updating the *name*, *description*, *urls* and *web_url* values as needed.\n\n\t{\n\t\t\"name\": \"Basecamp\",\n\t\t\"description\": \"Shortcut to Basecamp Launchpad\",\n\t\t\"manifest_version\": 2,\n\t\t\"version\": \"1.0.0.0\",\n\t\t\"icons\": {\n\t\t\t\"128\": \"128.png\"\n\t\t},\n\t\t\"app\": {\n\t\t\t\"urls\": [\"https:\/\/launchpad.37signals.com\/\"],\n\t\t\t\"launch\": {\n\t\t\t\t\"web_url\": \"https:\/\/launchpad.37signals.com\/\"\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t},\n\t\t\"permissions\": [\"unlimitedStorage\",\"notifications\"]\n\t}\n\nNow to add this shortcut app to Chrome. From the Chrome menu, select *Tools* > *Extensions*, then click the *Load unpacked extension* button. Browse to the folder in which these files are stored in and press OK\/Confirm.\n\nNow when you open a new tab, you should see your new icon! Also, you can customise your shortcut app by right clicking on it.\n\n![Customise shortcut app](\/images\/brendan\/chrome-app-customise.png)\n*I think this one deserves a pin*",
            "20130607_website-performance-tips": "# Website performance tips\n_7 Jun 2013_\n\n[Colt McAnlis](https:\/\/twitter.com\/duhroach) gave an insightful talk recently named *Performance Checklist for the Mobile Web* ([Video](http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=0UNWi7FA36M), [Slides](http:\/\/mainroach.appspot.com\/docs\/PCMW.pdf)), where he explains:\n\n> One in four users will abandon a site if it's not loaded in three seconds\n\nIs that enough time to load that crazy video slider the client wants on the home page? Probably not. Statistics like this one help developers and clients focus their ideas in to what really matters: *the main message of the website*.\n\nIf you've removed all the superfluous content and are still struggling with the load time, there are ways developers can optimise website performance. [Let's have a look](https:\/\/vine.co\/v\/bQbrUJPzJ5Y).\n\n## Find an appropriate web host\n\nConsider the options and select the [web host](http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Web_hosting_service) that suits the project's needs, such as:\n\n- What programming languages do you need it to support?\n- Which country should the server be located in?\n- Do they have automatic backup systems in place?\n\nLook for companies with a proven history of great service, value and support. Personally, I use [MediaTemple](http:\/\/mediatemple.net\/). Some other options are [RackSpace](http:\/\/www.rackspace.com.au\/) and [NetRegistry](http:\/\/www.netregistry.com.au\/web-hosting\/cloud-hosting\/).\n\n## Use a performance testing tool\n\nUse tools like [WebPageTest](http:\/\/www.webpagetest.org\/) and [PageSpeed](https:\/\/developers.google.com\/speed\/pagespeed\/) to get feedback on where a website's performance can improve.\n\n## Minify\n\nReduce the size of CSS and JS files by [minifying](http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Minification_(programming)) their contents in production environments, I recommend [Online YUI Compressor](http:\/\/refresh-sf.com\/yui) for this.\n\n## Use image sprites\n\nWhen your design requires a large amount of images, you can speed this up by combining them in to one sprite image. Then you can show certain sections of the image where needed via CSS.\n\nAn A List Apart article, [CSS Sprites: Image Slicing\u2019s Kiss of Death](http:\/\/alistapart.com\/article\/sprites), explains this technique much better than I can.\n\n## Reduce the length of CSS selectors\n\nDon't be so specific! Longer selectors take longer for the browser to interpret, which affects page load times.\n\nToo specific:\n\n\tul.post-list li div.author span.name{\n\t\tfont-size:90%;\n\t}\n\nMuch better:\n\n\t.post-list .name{\n\t\tfont-size:90%;\n\t}\n\n## Set caching rules for certain file types\n\nMost of the assets included in a web page don't change very often, especially images.\nIf you're using [Apache](http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Apache_web_server) as your web server, you can tell the browser when it needs to check for a new version in a [.htaccess file](http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Htaccess):\n\n\t<filesMatch \".(ico|gif|jpg|png|eot|ttf|woff|svg)$\">\n\t\tExpiresActive On\n\t\tExpiresDefault \"access plus 11 month\"\n\t\tHeader append Cache-Control \"public\"\n\t<\/filesMatch>\n\t<filesMatch \".(css|js)$\">\n\t\tExpiresActive On\n\t\tExpiresDefault \"access plus 1 month\"\n\t\tHeader append Cache-Control \"public\"\n\t<\/filesMatch>\n\nThis will tell the browser to keep a cached version of image files for up to a year, and CSS and JS files for a month.\n\n## Setup gzip compression\n\n[Gzip compression](https:\/\/developers.google.com\/speed\/articles\/gzip) is a technique to compress HTML at the web server level before it reaches the visitor's browser. To enable it, add the following to your *.htaccess file*:\n\n\t<ifmodule mod_deflate.c>\n\t\tAddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE text\/text text\/html text\/plain text\/xml text\/css application\/x-javascript application\/javascript\n\t<\/ifmodule>\n\nNotice anything I've missed or have something to add? Great! Let's [discuss further on Twitter](https:\/\/twitter.com\/brendanmurty\/status\/342901968458612736).",

This allows the user to access them quickly and your web app earns it's place amongst the users' other apps.\n\nThere are a few things to remember when implementing this feature in your web app.\n\n#### iOS and Android\n\nTo ensure that [iOS](http:\/\/www.apple.com\/ios\/) doesn't apply the default shine to your icon, you'll need to use the correct tag in the *head* section of your page:\n\n\t<link rel=\"apple-touch-icon-precomposed\" href=\"\/images\/logo-114.png\">\n\n[Android](http:\/\/www.android.com\/) browsers also support this method, sweet!\n\n#### Windows 8\n\nFor Windows 8\/RT devices, you'll just need to include the following in the *head* section of your page:\n\n\t<meta name=\"application-name\" content=\"YourWebApp\"\/>\n\t<meta name=\"msapplication-TileColor\" content=\"#325ba0\"\/>\n\t<meta name=\"msapplication-TileImage\" content=\"\/images\/logo-144-clear.png\"\/>\n\t<meta name=\"msapplication-starturl\" content=\"\/webapphome.php\" \/>\n\n#### Windows Phone\n\nUnfortunately, [Windows Phone](http:\/\/www.windowsphone.com\/) requires a little more setup. You'll have to form up a unique page for Windows Phone users, a sample *pin to start page* is:\n\n\t<!doctype html>\n\t<html>\n\t\t<head>\n\t\t\t<title>YourWebApp<\/title>\n\t\t\t<meta charset=\"utf-8\">\n\t\t\t<meta name=\"robots\" content=\"noindex,nofollow\">\n\t\t\t<meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"maximum-scale=1,minimum-scale=1,width=device-width\">\n\t\t\t<style>\n\t\t\t\tbody{margin:0;position:relative;background-color:#325ba0;color:#fff;height:100%;width:100%;padding:0}\n\t\t\t\t#icon{font-size:160px;line-height:320px;text-align:center}\n\t\t\t\t#instructions{margin-top:60px;text-align:center;position:relative;color:#eee}\n\t\t\t\t#instructions strong{color:#fff}\n\t\t\t<\/style>\n\t\t<\/head>\n\t\t<body>\n\t\t\t<div id=\"icon\">\n\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"\/images\/logo-160.png\" alt=\"YourWebApp\" \/>\n\t\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<div id=\"instructions\">\n\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\tTap <strong>...<\/strong> and select <strong>pin to start<\/strong>\n\t\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<script>\n\t\t\t\tvar url = 'https:\/\/yourwebapp.com\/webapphome.php';\n\t\t\t\tif(localStorage.getItem(url)) {\n\t\t\t\t\twindow.location.replace(url);\n\t\t\t\t}else{\n\t\t\t\t\tlocalStorage.setItem(url, true);\n\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t<\/script>\n\t\t<\/body>\n\t<\/html>\n\nThis will produce a screen similar to the image below:\n\n![Add to home page](\/images\/brendan\/addtohome-page.jpg)\n\nAnd after following the directions on the page, it's now on the user's home screen:\n\n![Home screen](\/images\/brendan\/homescreen.png)\n\nLooks great!\n\nI'd also recommend a guide to assist your users in adding the page to their home screen, as I've done for UpcomingTasks on the [Add to Home](http:\/\/upcomingtasks.com\/pages\/addtohome.php) page.\n\n#### Notes\n\n - Images referenced in the sample code above should be square PNGs at 114px and 160px square respectively\n - The image used above named *logo-144-clear.png* should be a 144px square transparent PNG\n - Replace *https:\/\/yourwebapp.com\/webapphome.php* with the complete URL to your web app's home page\n - Replace *YourWebApp* with the name of your web app\n - You might need to customise the colours defined in the CSS to match your app's design\n - The JavaScript in the Windows Phone page is required so the browser knows to redirect to the app home page after the first view\n\n#### Sources and inspiration\n\n - [iOS Web App Configuration](https:\/\/gist.github.com\/jdaihl\/472519)\n - [Making An Awesome Windows 8 Pinned Tile for your Website](http:\/\/dontcodetired.com\/blog\/post\/Making-An-Awesome-Windows-8-Pinned-Tile-for-your-Website.aspx)\n - [Creating a pinnable Windows Phone 7 tile for your website like Google](http:\/\/www.russellbeattie.com\/blog\/creating-a-pinnable-windows-phone-7-tile-for-your-website-like-google)",

            "20131217_more-than-writing-code": "# More Than Writing Code\n_17 Dec 2013_\n\nLooking to further my knowledge in my web development career, I recently bought [Effective Programming: More Than Writing Code](http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Effective-Programming-More-Than-Writing-ebook\/dp\/B008HUMTO0) by [Jeff Atwood](https:\/\/twitter.com\/codinghorror).\n\nJeff has had a successful career as a developer and you probably know of him as the founder of [Stack Overflow](http:\/\/stackoverflow.com\/), the *question and answer* site for programmers. He's been [blogging about technology](http:\/\/www.codinghorror.com\/blog\/) since 2004, so it's pretty obvious that he's knowledgable in his field.\n\nIn short, I found this book insightful and refreshing, especially in a field filled with with overly technical books. Instead of concentrating on specific programming languages or techniques, this book outlines the related skills required in today's programming jobs.\n\nI found the sections about working in programming teams quite interesting:\n\n> If you want to be successful, stop worrying about the great ideas, and contentrate on cultivating great teams.\n\n> ... at the point where you're actively campaigning against the projects, and working against your teammates - you're a liability to the project\n\n> Removing someone from a team is painful; it's not fun for anyone. But realizing you should have removed someone six months ago is far more painful\n\nJeff also explains how usability testing on a budget is possible:\n\n> Usability testing doesn't have to be complicated. If you really want to know if what you're building works, ask someone to use it while you watch... don't tell them what to do. Give them a task, and remind them to think out loud while they do it. Then quietly sit back and watch what happens\n\nSome thoughts on the basic needs of an effective programmer:\n\n> I propose we adopt a Programmer's Bill of Rights, protecting the rights of programmers by preventing companies from denying them the fundamentals they need to be successful.\n\n> 1. Every programmer shall have two monitors\n> 2. Every programmer shall have a fast PC\n> 3. Every programmer shall have their choice of mouse and keyboard\n> 4. Every programmer shall have a comfortable chair\n> 5. Every programmer shall have a fast internet connection\n> 6. Every programmer shall have quiet working conditions\n\nHear, hear!\n\nThis is the kind of book that I think I'll be referring back to at many places in my web development career.\n\nI'd recommend this book to any programmer who is currently part of a programming team or who has a passion for managing programming teams. If this sounds like you, you should just [buy it now from Amazon](http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Effective-Programming-More-Than-Writing-ebook\/dp\/B008HUMTO0), you won't regret it.",

It had a small, loyal user base of about 1,000 users.\n\nWith the recent release of [Basecamp 3](https:\/\/basecamp.com\/) with a [new API](https:\/\/github.com\/basecamp\/bc3-api), I've hesitated in developing updates to UpcomingTasks to support the newest version of Basecamp. This is mainly due to the limited amount of free time I have amongst my full-time job and spending time with friends and family.\n\nI've thought long and hard about keeping this product going indefinitely, but as I pay a monthly fee to host the website and it generates no income, it's hard for me to let it continue in this way. Instead of letting UpcomingTasks become outdated and abandoned, I've decided to **retire the product on the 15th of November, 2016**.\n\n## What happens to your data?\n\nAll of your project, task and user data is stored in your Basecamp 2 account and not on the UpcomingTasks server, so there will be no loss of data.\n\n## What happens on the 15th of November, 2016?\n\nThe website, upcomingtasks.com, will redirect to this blog post.\n\nAll related UpcomingTasks services and accounts will be shut down.\n\nAll users will no longer be able to access UpcomingTasks.\n\nAll users will still be able to access and modify their Basecamp data at [basecamp.com\/2](https:\/\/basecamp.com\/2)\n\n## Who should you contact if you have any questions?\n\nIf you have any questions about this, please feel free to email me directly at [brendan@murty.email](mailto:brendan@murty.email)\n",

            "20191116_fixing-software-bugs-without-losing-your-mind": "# Fixing software bugs without losing your mind\n_16 Nov 2019_\n\nNo matter what we do to avoid them, [all software has bugs](https:\/\/m.signalvnoise.com\/software-has-bugs-this-is-normal\/).\n\nSoftware is created by humans, who all make mistakes, get distracted, misunderstand things and lose focus. This is unavoidable.\n\nEvery new line of code is likely to introduce new bugs in a system. We have testing processes, but these can never guarantee a bug-free system.\n\nSo how should a developer react to a new bug report? I'll try to cover my general thought process below.\n\n## Step 1: Information Gathering\n\n- What is the impact of this bug?\n- When does this bug need to be fixed?\n- Which area(s) of the system are\/is affected?\n- Is the whole system not working because of this?\n- Is the issue isolated to a certain type of user?\n- Has this issue been validated by the reporter themselves?\n- What is the process you have to go through to experience this bug?\n- What should the system do instead of what it currently does?\n\n## Step 2: Assessment\n\n- Do I need help with this?\n- How important is this bug?\n- Should I finish my current task or work on this bug right now?\n- Who can help me fix this bug?\n- Do I have what I need to start working on this?\n\n## Step 3: Communication\n\n- Make it clear you've received the bug report\n- Explain when you'll be working on fixing it\n- Give an expectation of when you think you can fix the issue\n\n## Step 4: Issue Resolution\n\n- If a temporary fix can be applied, do that first. This will give you more time to work on a more robust solution in a more relaxed timeline\n- Focus on fixing the reported issue\n- Go through the process from the bug report\n- Add debugging statements through-out this process\n- Apply the least amount of change to the system that you can\n\n## Step 5: Reporting\n\n- Update the bug report with a high-level summary of the changes made to fix the bug\n- Ask the reporter to confirm the issue is now fixed\n- Update your technical documentation, such as code comments\n\n## Step 6: Reflection\n\n- Assess how this bug was introduced into the system\n- How did this get through testing?\n- Should the testing process be updated to cover issues like this in the future?\n- What was learnt in the process of fixing this bug?\n- What should have been done differently to avoid this?\n- Remind yourself that all-things-considered, you have people that care for you and this bug was not the end of the world as we know it\n"
